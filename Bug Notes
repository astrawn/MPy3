Issue: Holding spacebar repeatedly starts and stops stream.
Solution: Introduce while loop within if statements with an "ispressed" boolean.
Resolved: No
---------------------------------
Issue: Stream continues after file is done playing. Possible issue with [while(data != '')].
Solution: Change conditional to [while(data)]. Or something of that sort. Testing needed.
Resolved: No
